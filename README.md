# WeatherApp
This is a read me file explaing what my Weather app does.
This Weather app is built in visual studio 2022, allowing users to login/register, and being able to check the current weather for any city.

Instrctions:
Step 1- load visual studio and click on clone a repository on the right

Step 3- click on clone and wait for the project to load.
Step 4 - On the right, click on WeatherApp-main, then source, then weather app then double click on weather.sln
Step 5 - Once everything is loaded, click the second green play button at the top(it should say start without debugging)
